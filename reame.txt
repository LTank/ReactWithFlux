For update all dependencies type "npm update"

In this project i have used:

 - Node: for installing and managing all dependencies.
 - Browerify: Bundles all css and JS packages and compiles react JSX.
 - Bootstrap: for CSS.
 - ESLint: helps with errors and typos in JS, holds me up to bedst practices everytime i hit save.
 - Gulp: running the build, watching the files for changes, opening a webserver, opening the app, 
            and autoreloads the hole thing everytime i hit save.
